## Description

The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience in working with a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment. The project is structured around three core components:

* Wazuh for SIEM and XDR functionalities (log collection, monitoring)

* TheHive for case management

* Shuffle for SOAR capabilities

To simulate a real SOC setup, I will deploy and configure the following virtual machines in the cloud:

* 1 Windows 10 VM (to generate endpoint activity and simulate user/system events)

* 1 Wazuh server running on Ubuntu (to collect and analyze logs, detect anomalies, and generate alerts)

* 1 TheHive server running on Ubuntu (to manage alerts and incidents, track investigations, and assign tasks)
