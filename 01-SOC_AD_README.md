## Description

The goal of this project is to create a real-world simulation of a SOC analystâ€™s role. In this scenario, an attacker machine successfully logs into a test system, triggering a playbook that requires the SOC analyst to assess whether the activity represents a legitimate threat. 
Once the primary objective is achieved, `additional automation will be integrated` to enhance the workflow.

## Setup

Here are the steps of project:
1. Setting up 2 windows servers and 1 Ubuntu server in `Vultr`
2. Configuring and protecting them with firewall so I will only be able to access them
3. Configuring main Win Server (Sambol.local) Acive directory and promoting it to domain controller
4. Joining Test machine to `Sambol` domain
