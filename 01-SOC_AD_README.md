# SOC with Active directory project

Tools used in this project:
* Splunk for SIEM, Slack for case management and Suffle for SOAR capabilities. 
* Small active directory environment with user to perform authentication
* 3 VM-s are created in the cloud using Vultr

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a real-world simulation of a SOC analystâ€™s role. In this scenario, an attacker machine successfully logs into a test system, triggering a playbook that requires the SOC analyst to assess whether the activity represents a legitimate threat. 
Once the primary objective is achieved, `additional automation will be integrated` to enhance the workflow.

## Setup

Here are the steps of project:
1. Setting up 2 windows servers and 1 Ubuntu server in `Vultr`
2. Configuring and protecting them with firewall so I will only be able to access them
3. Configuring main Win Server (Sambol.local) Acive directory and promoting it to domain controller
4. Joining Test machine to `Sambol` domain
5. Instaling splunk on ubuntu server
    * Instaling is done by downloading splung .deb file and runing it
    * After that running /opt/splunk/bin# ./splunk start command to accept user rights
    * This triggers the Ramining configuration
    * Also port 8000 needs to be anabled in ubunto firewall with command: 
        ```sh
        ufw allow 8000
        ```



## Splunk

Steps that I made for configuring splunk:

* Instaling add-on for windows
* Added custom index
* Also added forwarding default port 9997
* install universal forwarder


## Errors along the way

* Currently I have a problem that my test windows server is not sending or doesn't have connection to Ubuntu server where the Splunk is. So I am not getting any telemetry from windows logs
    ```
    FIX: with a lot if failed tries, deleting/installing universal forwarder as well as configuring outputs.config file and testing connection. Problem was that I haven't login to splunk as my universal forwarder required my credentials.
    ```
